<p>My name is Nicholas Murray-Ishihara, and I'm a founding software engineer specializing in ML infrastructure, full-stack applications, and healthcare technology. I'm passionate about building scalable systems that solve complex problems, from distributed training platforms to healthcare data applications.</p>

<p>I graduated in 2019 from Washington University in St. Louis with a B.S. in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a Professional Certificate in Embedded Engineering from UC San Diego. In my downtime, I enjoy golf, playing chess, and visiting indie bookstores.</p>
